* Consolidate Search algorithms code
	-> Move evaluation of expanded nodes from do_search() method into process_node()
	-> Allow to parametrize search classes by Expansion_Policy objects
		-> That is, move process_node() out of the search and put into a function object class
		   named Lazy_Expansion
	-> More still to be decided

* Support for Lazy Node Generation
	-> This prevents from checking for duplicates in OPEN

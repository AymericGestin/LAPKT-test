The planners $\SR$, $BFS(f)$ have been implemented on top of a novel
automated planning framework \texttt{lwaptk}\footnote{Source code available from
\url{https://github.com/miquelramirez/lwaptk}.}. \texttt{lwaptk} is an extensible \texttt{C++}
framework that decouples search and heuristic algorithms from \textsc{Pddl} parsing and grounding modules, by relying
on planner "agnostic" data structures to represent (ground) fluents and actions.
We consider \texttt{lwaptk} to be a valuable contribution as it allows to build a planning system by combining 
readily available implementations of search algorithms and planning heuristics, without
depending on specific parsing modules and grounding algorithms. Systems built in this manner
can then be tested on \textsc{Ipc} benchmarks by "plugging" the planner into any of several available 
parsing and grounding strategies and algorithms, most notably those of the \textsc{FF}~\cite{hoffmann:ff}
planner and the \textsc{Fast-Downward} framework~\cite{helmert:fd}. Or alternatively, and more interestingly,
the planner can be embedded into complex applications, \emph{directly}, if the "host" application is written in 
\texttt{C++}, or \emph{indirectly} when the host is written in an interpreted language, such as \textsc{Python}, 
by wrapping the planner with suitably generated marshalling code.

While the blind-search \SR\ procedure competes well with a greedy
best-first planner using the additive heuristic, neither planner is
state-of-the-art. Since state-of-the-art performance is important in
classical planning, we show next that it is possible to deliver such
performance by integrating the idea of novelty that arises from width
considerations, with known techniques such as helpful actions,
landmarks, and heuristics. For this, we switch to a standard
\emph{forward-search best-first planner} guided by an evaluation function
that combines the notions of novelty and
helpful actions \cite{nir:ecai12,hoffmann:ff}. Additionally, ties are broken
lexicographically by two other measures:
(1) the number of subgoals not yet achieved up to a node in the search, and
(2) the additive heuristic, $h_{add}$.

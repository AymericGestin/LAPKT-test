While the blind-search \SR\ procedure competes well with a greedy
best-first planner using the additive heuristic, neither planner is
state-of-the-art. Since state-of-the-art performance is important in
classical planning, we show next that it is possible to deliver such
performance by integrating the idea of novelty that arises from width
considerations, with known techniques such as helpful actions,
landmarks, and heuristics. For this we switch to a \emph{plain
  forward-search best-first planner} guided by an evaluation function
$f(n)$ over the nodes $n$ that combines novelty and
helpful actions \cite{nir:ecai12}.  In addition, ties are broken
lexicographically by two other measures: first, $usg(n)$, that counts
the number of subgoals not yet achieved up to $n$, and second,
$h_{add}(n)$, that is the additive heuristic.
